# Final project Intro2CS – a complete Boggle game.

We use Tkinter and Pygame libraries to create a complete Boggle game. 
As you can observe I split the code into 3 main files – GUI, Controller and Runner. 
We were given a free hand in this project with no restrictions, so every decision that was made (design / implementation) was solely made by me. 

I added some visualization features, like disabling buttons that cannot be chosen and more.

There is also a version that was strapped with pyinstaller to create an exe for the game, can be sent with needed.
